# Personal Project
Welcome to my Todo List Project!

This is a Todo List application that allows the user to add, remove, and view their tasks.

To start...run the "Main" file.

Users can have 3 types of tasks which are as follows:
- Normal
- Secret
- Urgent

To add or remove a certain task, make sure you have the correct task "type" selected and it will remove your desired task from that type.
If you want to remove by wording, it is programed to ONLY remove if the EXACT spelling is inputted.

Hit the save button if you want to save the tasks you currently have and you can pick up where you left off!

Have fun using this Todo List!
